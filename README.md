=====================

Archives information that Twitter's archive does not

###Introduction###

These python scripts allow you to archive information that is not included in Twitter's archive tool.
Currently the scripts create CSV files of your followers and following lists.

###Implementation###
You will need to create a Twitter API application and fill out the ```APP_KEY``` and ```APP_SECRET``` in the files.
Also, be sure to fill out the username you wish to get the followers or following lists for.
Finally, there is an optional advanced mode which saves other returned information such as time zone, language, and account creation date.  This is by default not enabled.
